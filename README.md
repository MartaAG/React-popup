This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Popup

A popup to use on a website.

## Basic use

The popup is supposed to collect from users their decisions regarding personal data processing. It fetches a text and a list of vendors. User will decide which vendor he accepts and his decision is saved to cookies

## How to use

Clone the project or simply download it. Paste it into your 'src' folder and run 'npm start'

## Dependencies
For this project I used [js-cookie](https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-cookie).
For tests I used jest with enzyme.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
